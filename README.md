# EquationSolver
Solve a simple handwritten equation bounded by a rectangle through a photo.

## Overview
These major parts make up the system;
- Equation extraction using rectangles as clues to find where the equation is.
- Character extraction to obtain the written equation.
- Parsing and mathematical evaluation of the written equation.
- Data collection, extraction, and tools to generate caffe readable datasets.

Note: the model is shallow right for testing on pi.
